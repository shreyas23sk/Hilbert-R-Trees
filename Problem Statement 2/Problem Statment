You need to implement the Hilbert-R-tree data structure all its operations are explained in the paper. Build the structure over the dataset given in data.txt. This consists of 21 two-dimensional data points, one per line. You can choose m=2 and M=4 for the tree you are building. For better understanding of R-trees, a few other articles are also given in the same directory.

Then implement a pre order traveral of the tree you have build which prints the MBR values (top right point and bottom left point of the MBR being printed) for each internal node traversed, and prints the 2-D objects stored in them while traversing the leaf nodes. Clear distinction is to be made while printing, whether the node you are printing is internal node or external node.
